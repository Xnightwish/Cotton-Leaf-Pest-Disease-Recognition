# Cotton-Leaf-Pest-Disease-Recognition
SpemNet, a Cotton leaf pest and disease identification model constructed based on Vision_transformer, adds the SPE bias module to Vision_transformer for image feature enhancement, and in addition, the EMA module is added to enhance the extraction of features.

The corresponding pth file for each model in the model_comparative folder is too large, so please download it yourself.
